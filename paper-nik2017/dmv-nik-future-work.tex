\section{Future Work}

The most vital future step for DMV is to implement the planned network features, to move DMV from the local case to the distributed case.
We would also incorporate the performance insights from these experiments and switch DMV to an aggregating storage format.
An important disk-space optimization would be to create a virtual copy-on-write filesystem that is a view into a \gls{tree} in the \gls{DMV} repository.
A virtual filesystem could be used as the working directory, eliminating the wasted disk space of having a second writable copy of all files, and it would eliminate the copying of those files back into the immutable data store on \gls{commit}.
It would also be interesting to perform these experiments on other filesystems and disk hardware to see how they behave.
It would be particularly interesting to see if solid state drives experience the same slowdown with randomized writes.
