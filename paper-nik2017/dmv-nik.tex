\section*{OUTLINE}

\begin{verbatim}

- Problem: many devices, more data, difficult to follow what is where

- Cloud not solution. Relies on third party. Connection, privacy, etc.

- DVCS: An alternate approach

    - Extreme availability
    - Version history gives chain of causality for later reconciliation

- Interesting properties of DAG

    - DAG gives de-duplication
    - Content addressing gives tampering/bitrot protection
    - DAG also gives convenient ways to shard data

- Problem 1: dealing with larger files: chunking

    - Bup has chunking but locked into backup workflow

- Problem 2: dealing with many files: packing

    - Git has packing but in separate step that fails for large files

- Problem 3: increasing data: sharding

- In-between: de-duplication

- DMV prototype

- Experiments

    - File size and number of files
    - Random writes

- Results

- Conclusion

    - chunk, content-address, re-pack
    - DMV not yet viable, but it's a start
