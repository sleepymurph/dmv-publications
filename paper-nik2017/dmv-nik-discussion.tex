\subsection{Reading Whole Files into RAM Limits File Size to RAM}

By using files as the basic unit of storage, and storing files as deltas against
a base revision, both Git and Mercurial will at some point load an entire file
into memory in order to compare it to another version. This limits the maximum
file size that the system can work with to what can fit into RAM. In Mercurial's
case, the error message that appears when attempting to \gls{commit} a
\SI{2}{\gib} file warns that \SI{6}{\gib} will be required to manage it. And
because it has to calculate deltas in order to store a file at all, Mercurial
simply cannot work with any file that it can't fit into memory three times over.
This is why Mercurial could not store files larger than \SI{1.5}{\gib} in the
file-size experiments.

Because Git's delta calculation happens behind-the-scenes in a secondary phase,
it can still manage to \gls{commit} files larger than available RAM, but it
prints errors as the other operations fail. The two-phase approach also requires
extra disk space and processing power. If a large file is changed, then both
revisions will be written in full, taking twice the disk space. Then a separate
operation will have to reread both \glspl{blob} in full to calculate deltas and
pack the objects.

Both \gls{DMV} and Bup avoid these pitfalls by operating with a finer
granularity, using a \gls{rollinghash} to divide files into chunks by their
content. It is the chunks and their indexes that must fit into memory, not the
entire file. And then since chunks are only a few kilobytes and chunk indexes
are hierarchical, file size becomes theoretically unlimited. Dividing into
chunks by \gls{rollinghash} also makes delta compression unnecessary, because
identical chunks in different files or file revisions will naturally
de-duplicate. At this point, it is the method of object storage that becomes the
bottleneck.

\subsection{Naming Files by Hash Leads to Inefficient Writes}

DMV's super-linear commit time increase when storing a large file is due to the way it breaks the large file into chunks and stores objects as individual files on the filesystem.
So its performance characteristic for storing a large file is closer to that of storing many files.
Both Git and DMV have super-linear commit time increases as the number of files increases.
This is because both Git and DMV store objects with directory and file names taken from the object's SHA-1 hash ID.
These randomized writes are inefficient for spinning disks and incur significant overhead as the writes jump from directory to directory.
This slows both Git and DMV down down significantly as the number of objects increases.
Mercurial stores data in files named after the original input files, so they can be written in the order that they are read, without all the jumping back and forth between directories.
Bup also breaks large files into chunks, but it aggregates objects into pack files.
So in addition to conserving inodes, Bup's writes are sequential and more efficient than the others.
This is why Bup is consistently the fastest.


\subsection{Storing Many Small Files Leads to Inefficient Use of Disk Space}

Git, Mercurial, DMV, and the copy all create one file in their \glspl{objectstore} for each input file.
So to store \num{7.5} million files, they will create \num{7.5} million more, resulting in \num{15} million files on the filesystem, plus directories.
However, the \SI{197}{\gib} experiment partition has \num{13107200} total \glspl{inode}, so storing \num{15} million files is impossible.

Bup is able to store more files because it does not write a separate object file for each input file.
Bup aggregates its DAG objects into \glspl{packfile}, writing several large files instead many small files.
As such, it does not exhaust the disk's \glspl{inode}, and can continue until the experiment itself exhausts the system's \glspl{inode} when it tries to go up from \num{10} million files to the next step and run a trial with \num{25} million files.
