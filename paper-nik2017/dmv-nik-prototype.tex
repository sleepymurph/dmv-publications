\section{Distributed Media Versioning}

\written{We developed an early prototype of such a system, which we call Distributed Media Versioning (DMV).}

\glsreset{DMV}

\gls{DMV} is our new distributed data storage platform.
The core idea is relatively simple --- store data in a Git-like \gls{DAG}, but make the following changes:

\begin{tight_enumerate}

    \item{Store data at a finer granularity than the file}

    \item{Allow nodes to store only a portion of the \gls{DAG} as a whole}

\end{tight_enumerate}

Doing so allows a data set to be replicated or sharded across many nodes according to the capacity of nodes and the needs of local users.
The focus is on data locality: tracking what data is where, presenting that information to the user, and making it easy to transfer data to other nodes as desired.
The ultimate goal is to create a new abstraction, of \emph{many devices, one data item} in varying states of synchronization.

%

\gls{DMV}'s data set and its history are represented as a \acrshort{DAG} (\acrlong{DAG}, see \autoref{how-data-stored-in-git}), and the rest of the design flows from that.
\gls{DMV}'s \gls{DAG} is based on Git's, but it adds a new object type, the \gls{chunkedblob}, which represents a \gls{blob} that has been broken into several smaller chunks.
An example \gls{DMV} \gls{DAG} is shown in \autoref{dia_dmv_dag_example_three_commits}.


Files are split into chunks using a \gls{rollinghash} such as Rabin-Karp fingerprinting~\cite{rabin_karp_fingerprinting}.
\todo{It's the rsync algorithm}
This splits the files into chunks by content rather than position, so that identical chunks within files (and especially different versions of the same file) will be found and stored as identical objects, regardless of their position within the file.
This way, identical chunks will be naturally de-duplicated by the \gls{DAG}, and only the changed portions of files need to be stored as new objects.

We have written a \gls{DMV} prototype as a proof-of-concept. The \gls{DMV}
prototype is written in the Rust programming language and it runs from the Unix
command line, with the executable built as a thin wrapper around a library, so
that it can be used by other applications.

The \gls{DMV} prototype was developed with Rust stable versions 1.15 and 1.16 on
Debian Linux 8.6 ("Jessie"). The current DMV prototype stands at \num{7592}
lines of Rust code (\num{6565} excluding comments). Source code is available
alongside this dissertation in Munin, the University of Troms√∏'s open research
archive (\muninurl), and continued work can be found via the author's website
(\dmvurl).
