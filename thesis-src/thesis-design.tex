\section{DMV's DAG}

\gls{DMV}'s data set and its history are represented as a \acrshort{DAG}
(\acrlong{DAG}, see \autoref{how-data-stored-in-git}), and the rest of the
design flows from that. \gls{DMV}'s \gls{DAG} is based on Git's, but it adds a
new object type, the \gls{chunkedblob}, which represents a \gls{blob} that has
been broken into several smaller chunks. An example \gls{DMV} \gls{DAG} is shown
in \autoref{dia_dmv_dag_example_three_commits}.

        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{dia_new_dag}
    \caption{DMV DAG Object Types}
    \label{fig:dia_new_dag}
\end{figure}

The object types that make up the \gls{DMV} \gls{DAG} are as follows:

\begin{description}

    \item[Blob] As with Git, a \gls{blob} simply holds binary data.

    \item[Chunked blob] Unlike with Git, larger \glspl{blob} in \gls{DMV} are
        broken into chunks. Each \gls{chunkedblob} is an index of the
        \glspl{blob} (or other \glspl{chunkedblob}) that make up the larger
        \gls{blob}. A file that is stored in the system may be represented by a
        \gls{blob} (if it is only one chunk) or a \gls{chunkedblob}.

    \item[Tree] As with Git, a directory that is stored in the system is
        represented by a \gls{tree} object. The \gls{tree} refers to the
        \gls{blob}, \gls{chunkedblob}, or \gls{tree} that represents each file
        or subdirectory, along with metadata such as the filename.

    \item[Commit] As with Git, a \gls{commit} represents a given state of the
        data set. It refers to the \gls{tree} that represents the top-level
        directory of the data set at that state, along with metadata such as
        author, date, and description. It also refers to the previous
        \gls{commit} (or \glspl{commit}) that represented the previous state of
        the data set.

    \item[Ref] As with Git, a \gls{ref} is a reference to a particular
        \gls{commit}. A \gls{ref} might represent the current state of a branch of
        development, or a particular state to save for later (a tag).

\end{description}

The \gls{DAG} begins with \glspl{ref}. Each repository has a list of \glspl{ref}
that lead into the \gls{DAG}. Each \gls{ref} refers to a \gls{commit}. Each
\gls{commit} refers to a \gls{tree} that represents the state at the time of
committing, plus one or more parent \glspl{commit}. A \gls{tree} refers to the
\gls{blob}, \gls{chunkedblob}, or \gls{tree} that makes up each entry in the
directory. A \gls{chunkedblob} can refer to other \glspl{chunkedblob} or to
\glspl{blob}. And finally, the \glspl{blob} are the leaves of the graph. These
relationships are illustrated in \autoref{fig:dia_new_dag}.



Files are split into chunks using a \gls{rollinghash} such as Rabin-Karp
fingerprinting~\cite{rabin_karp_fingerprinting}. This splits the files into
chunks by content rather than position, so that identical chunks within files
(and especially different versions of the same file) will be found and stored as
identical objects, regardless of their position within the file. This way,
identical chunks will be naturally de-duplicated by the \gls{DAG}, and only the
changed portions of files need to be stored as new objects.

\section{Working with an Incomplete DAG}
\label{working-with-incomplete-dag}

The \gls{DAG} stores the full history of a data set, and it can be sliced to
partition the data in space and time.

\begin{description}

    \item[Partial history of full data set] Keep a subset of \glspl{commit},
        plus all \glspl{tree}, \glspl{blob}, and \glspl{chunkedblob} reachable
        from them (\autoref{dia_dmv_dag_slice_partial_history}).

    \item[Full history of part of data set] Keep all \glspl{commit}, but keep
        only the \glspl{tree}, \glspl{blob}, and \glspl{chunkedblob} for certain
        paths (\autoref{dia_dmv_dag_slice_history_of_subset}).

    \item[Full history of metadata] Keep all \glspl{commit} and \glspl{tree},
        but omit \glspl{blob} and \glspl{chunkedblob}
        (\autoref{dia_dmv_dag_slice_history_of_metadata}).

\end{description}

\end{figure}

A \gls{DMV} \gls{repository} may use any combination of these slicing techniques
to keep only those objects needed at that location, and new \glspl{commit} can
still be added to a partial \gls{DAG}. A \gls{repository} that stores only part
of the data set can create new \glspl{commit} that represent changes to that
portion of the data set by assuming that everything else remains unchanged. Even
a metadata-only \gls{repository} could create new \glspl{commit} that represent
renames and reorganization of the same files.

So the \gls{DAG} can be spread across many \glspl{repository}, sliced according
to what is needed at each location. \Glspl{repository} will keep a record of
what objects exist at their neighbors, along with statistics about latency when
connecting to those \glspl{repository}. This will allow them to estimate how
long it would take to transfer a file that is not currently present on the
system.

Though we did not have time to implement this feature, we are envisioning an
enhanced \lstinline{ls} command output that shows these estimates, as
illustrated in \autoref{example-ls-output}.
