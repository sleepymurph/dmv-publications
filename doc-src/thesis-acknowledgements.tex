\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my advisor, Otto J. Anshus, for his guidance and
encouragement, Ken Arne Jensen for finding free computers to run experiments on,
and Jan Fuglesteg for guiding me through administrative matters.

I would also like to thank Rolf Ole Jenssen and Coleman McFarland for their
invaluable feedback on my early drafts, and Sergiusz Michalik and Lars Dalheim
for their friendship and encouragement.

Moving to the arctic was my dream, and computer science is my passion.
Thank you to the University of Tromsø for giving me the opportunity to pursue
both at the same time.

Finally, I would like to thank Katrine Mellem for interrupting me during a
lunchtime discussion about US elections.

"I live in DC, so--"\\
"No! You live in Tromsø!"

That quip stands as the single most-welcoming thing a local has ever said to me,
and it marks the moment I started feeling like I truly had a place here.

Takk.
