\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my advisor, Otto J. Anshus, for his guidance,
encouragement, and invaluable feedback, Ken Arne Jensen for finding free
computers to run experiments on, and Jan Fuglesteg for guiding me through
administrative matters, answering the quotidian questions of a thirty-something
who had forgotten much of what he knew about how universities work.

I would also like to thank Rolf Ole Jenssen and Coleman McFarland for their
feedback on early drafts, and Sergiusz Michalik and Lars Dalheim for their
friendship and encouragement.

Thank you to my former supervisor, Pierce Hanley, who taught me most of what I
know about programming and who was always fun to argue with.

Moving to the arctic was my dream, and computer science is my passion.
Thank you to the University of Tromsø for giving me the opportunity to pursue
both at the same time.

Finally, I would like to thank Katrine Mellem for interrupting me during a
lunchtime discussion about US elections.

"I live in DC, so--"\\
"No! You live in Tromsø!"

That quip stands as the single most welcoming thing a local has ever said to me,
and it marks the moment I started feeling like I truly had a place here.

Takk.
