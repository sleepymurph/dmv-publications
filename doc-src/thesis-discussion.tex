\section{Possible Applications}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Individual users might use it to maintain a collection of important
    documents, photos, and media, making it easier to keep up-to-date backups
    and to synchronize between computers, mobile devices, and removable drives.

  \item Professional users that work with files too large for traditional
    version control, such as graphic designers, audio engineers, or maybe even
    video editors, might finally be able to adopt a version-control workflow.

  \item Corporate or government users might use it to maintain large archives of
    data with full history.

  \item Far-flung networks with high-latency or rare connectivity, such as
    remote wildlife sensors or Mars rovers, could use it to manage and
    synchronize data.

\end{itemize}



\section{As an Abstraction of Data Space and Time}

We are thinking about data across a number of dimensions:

\begin{description}

  \item[Coverage of data set] How much of the data set is available locally or
    in neighboring nodes?

  \item[Coverage of data history] How much of the data set's history is
    available locally or in neighboring nodes?

  \item[Divergence of versions] How many different branches has this data been
    forked into, and how different are they?

  \item[Number of replicas] How many times is the data replicated across
    neighboring nodes? Is any data in danger of being permanently lost?

  \item[Availability of or distance to replicas] Of the replicas available, how
    available are they? What is the bandwidth of the connection to the
    neighboring nodes? What is the latency?

\end{description}



\section{What the system should not do}

\todo{Update tense}
We want to focus on the problem of storing file history and synchronizing files
between replicas.
We should be careful not to expand across the wrong abstraction boundaries or to
try to do too much.
In particular:

\begin{itemize}

  \item We do not want to reinvent the filesystem. The system should place and
    update files on the filesystem (or offer a filesystem view, such as with
    FUSE) for applications to use normally. Applications such as editors should
    not have to be rewritten to use our system.

  \item We do not want to create new exotic file formats. We believe that the
    classic tree of files is our best chance for long-term storage.

  \item We hope this system could eventually be used as a piece of
    infrastructure on which to build useful applications. It should not
    incorporate functionality that would better be left to an application.

  \item We do not want to deal with media metadata and categorization. Metadata
    and categorization is best left to the applications that produce and consume
    those media formats. We will merely provide the storage.

  \item However, knowledge of media formats might be used for behind-the-scenes
    optimization such as more efficient compression. E.g. recognizing that only
    tag data has changed in an audio file.

\end{itemize}



\section{Limitations}

\towrite{non-programmers (and even some programmers) cannot handle Git
    - Key to usability would be to make as linear a history as possible with
        auto-updates, but that is the job of a separate app
    - Cite redesign of Git\cite{redesign_of_git}
