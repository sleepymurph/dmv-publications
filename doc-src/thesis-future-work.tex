\chapter{Future Work}

The primary goal of \gls{DMV} is to be a general low-level storage platform for
storing and tracking a data set across many nodes. The next step would be to
complete the networking features of the prototype so that it can actually be
used in real-life applications. Applications could layer additional technologies
on top of \gls{DMV} to create interesting systems. For example, a gossip
protocol could spread information about object availability on remote data
stores that are not directly connected, allowing data to be spread and
transfered across far-flung networks. To focus on usability, daemons could
automatically \gls{commit} changes and sync with other nodes, shielding users
from the complexity of branching where possible and trying to present a coherent
current state of the data set. An important optimization would be to create a
virtual filesystem that is a view into a \gls{tree} in the \gls{DMV} repository.
The virtual filesystem could be used as the working directory, eliminating the
wasted disk space of having a second writable copy of all files, and it would
eliminate the copying of those files back into the immutable data store on
\gls{commit}. A virtual filesystem would also make it much easier to write an
auto-\gls{commit} daemon, since writes would have to go through the filesystem.

We look forward to continuing to work on and expand the system. The project is
open source, and development continues online at \dmvurl~.
