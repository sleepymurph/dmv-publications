\section{Future Work}


\subsection{Possible extensions}

The goal of the system is to be a low-level platform for tracking a single data
set that is distributed across many nodes. Following the version-control
paradigm, most operations will be explicit. However, it will be possible to
write applications on top of this system that automate more operations.

\begin{itemize}

  \item A gossip protocol could spread information about availability of remote
    stores that are not directly connected.

  \item Daemons could auto-commit and auto-sync with other stores.

  \item To save storage space, the working directory can be a virtual filesystem
    that is a view into the object database.

\end{itemize}
