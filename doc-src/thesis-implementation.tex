\chapter{Implementation}

We have written a DMV prototype as a proof-of-concept. It is written in the Rust
programming language and it runs from the Unix command line.


\paragraph{Rust}

Rust is a new C-like systems language that uses a sophisticated static type
system to guarantee memory safety, avoiding data races in concurrent code as
well as the segmentation faults and buffer overflows that are so easy to write
in C. We chose Rust primarily because it is a compiled language. Compiling to
machine code gives us the best chance of porting DMV to low-powered or mobile
devices, and it allows us to compile DMV as a library that other applications
can link to and build on. Rust is also just a very pleasant language to work in.

    - Compiled for low-level control and high perf
    - Compiled for goal of running on mobile / low-powered systems
    - Rust is just nice to work in

\towrite{Prototype copies working directory and object store. Disadvantage: disk
space. Could use FUSE}
