As we ponder the challenges of big data, we programmers and computer scientists
often make use of humble tools that elegantly store small data: \acrlongpl{VCS}.
The current wave of \acrlongpl{VCS} such as Git and Mercurial are, in a sense,
small-scale distributed systems. Interestingly, with \acrlongpl{DVCS}, network
partitions are not a failure mode or an obstacle to be overcome but the default
mode of operation. This paper argues that the \glsdisp{DVCS}{distributed version
control} concept has potential applications to large scale distributed systems.
And to that end, it explores the scalability limits of existing \acrlongpl{DVCS}
and presents a design and prototype for a new, more-scalable system that we call
\gls{DMV}.
