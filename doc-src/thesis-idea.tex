\chapter{Idea: Distributed Media Versioning (DMV)}

TODO: Low-level distributed data store

TODO: New abstraction: "many devices, one data item", in varying states of
synchronization

TODO: Based on version control and DAG

TODO: Make everything explicit. Let user decide

TODO: Data set scalability goals
    - Media files (wide variety of sizes)
    - Large quantities (millions)
    - Too large to fit in conventional hard drive

TODO: End-to-end argument

TODO: Neutral
    - Normal hierarchy FS
    - No prescribed file formats
    - Files editable with normal applications

TODO: Based on version control but
    - Break up large files
    - Relax requirement to store all

TODO: Concept of data set in multiple dimensions: subset of set, subset of
history


TODO: Envisioned LS output

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example ls output]
    -rw-r--r-- 1 user user  121306 Oct 21 18:28 local   filex

\subsection{Main principles}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Data must never be lost accidentally.

  \item However, history may be deliberately truncated to save space, and
    sensitive data may be deliberately redacted.

  \item Data integrity must be verifiable: The system must be able to detect
    errors and, if possible, repair them.

  \item Changes to the dataset should be tracked, versions should be explicitly
    labeled, and history should be kept.

  \item Like with distributed version control, updates can be made independently
    and merged later. Different sites can have different versions. Updates
    (commits) and synchronization are deliberate, explicit, and manual.

\end{itemize}

TODO: But no hits in the computing domain, possibly because of the association
with the Department of Motor Vehicles
